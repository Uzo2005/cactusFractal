## What is this?
I am trying to use [L-systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) to generate cactus plants.

## How to play with what I have done so far

1. Install [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/install.html)

2. Install the raylib-bindings dependency
```sh
nimble install naylib
```

3. Run the main file
```sh
nim r main.nim
```
